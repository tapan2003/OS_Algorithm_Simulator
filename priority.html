            <h3>What is Preemptive Priority CPU Scheduling?</h3>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Preemptive Priority CPU Scheduling Algorithm is a pre-emptive method of CPU
                scheduling algorithm that works based on the priority of a process. In this algorithm, the scheduler
                schedules the tasks to work as per the priority, which means that a higher priority process should be
                executed first. In case of any conflict, i.e., when there is more than one process with equal
                priorities, then the pre-emptive priority CPU scheduling algorithm works on the basis of FCFS (First
                Come First Serve) algorithm.</p>

            <h3>Advantages of Preemptive Priority CPU Scheduling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficient utilization of resources: Preemptive priority scheduling ensures that the most important
                    tasks are executed first, which helps in efficient utilization of resources.</li>
                <li>Faster response time: Higher priority tasks are given priority over lower priority tasks, which
                    results in faster response times for important tasks.</li>
                <li>Guaranteed service: Preemptive priority scheduling ensures that the high-priority tasks are always
                    executed first, which provides guaranteed service for critical applications.</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>Disadvantages of Preemptive Priority Scheduling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Starvation: Preemptive priority scheduling can lead to starvation of lower priority tasks if higher
                    priority tasks keep arriving. This can lead to poor performance of the system.</li>
                <li>Priority inversion: Preemptive priority scheduling can also lead to priority inversion, where a
                    lower priority task holds a resource required by a higher priority task, resulting in the higher
                    priority task being blocked.</li>
                <li>Complexity: Preemptive priority scheduling is a complex algorithm that requires careful
                    implementation to ensure that the system operates as intended. This can increase the complexity of
                    the operating system and make it more difficult to maintain.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Algorithm steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Step-1: Select the first process whose arrival time will be 0, we need to select that process
                    because that process is only executing at time t=0.</li>
                <li>Step-2: Check the priority of the next available process. Here we need to check for 3 conditions.
                    <br>
                    if priority(current_process) > priority(prior_process) :- then execute the current process. <br>
                    if priority(current_process) < priority(prior_process) :- then execute the prior process. <br>
                        if priority(current_process) = priority(prior_process) :- then execute the process which arrives
                        first i.e., arrival time should be first.</li>
                <li>Step-3: Repeat Step-2 until it reaches the final process.</li>
                <li>Step-4: When it reaches the final process, choose the process which is having the highest priority &
                    execute it. Repeat the same step until all processes complete their execution.</li>
            </ul>
